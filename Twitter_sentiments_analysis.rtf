The overall Media sentiment bar chart provided more insight to Tweet analysis. This visualization provided a clearer picture to overall sentiments with the BBC having the most negative sentiments and FOX and NYT having more positive averages.  NYT is primarily print and online text, with many tweets providing access to articles.  The BBC and others may use Twitter to publish announcements as news, which may contribute to a greater negative sentiment.  The BBC was the only organization based outside of the USA, and its approach to journalism and Twitter seem to be reflected in the language their Tweets use. \
I found the scatterplot to have too much information, at first glance it doesn\'92t provide enough insight to Tweet sentiments.}
